# SkiFree.js

SkiFree clone made with JavaScript and HTML, using the same assets as the original. Created as an assignment for my Computer Science course.

[You can play it here!](https://tumut.github.io/SkiFree.js)

The game's interface is in Brazilian PortugueseðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· for now. I hope you don't mind.

## Details

The game differs slightly in gameplay from the original.

* Use **A**, **S** and **D** for controls. **F** still enables the turbo.
* The skier has lives, and hitting too many obstacles will give you a Game Over.
* Flaming bushes take 2 of your lives!
* You need to obtain mushrooms in order to recover your health.
* A dog will show up every once in a while, trying to get on your way.
* An abominable snowman will be spawned every 3000m and, if he catches you, will end your game regardless of how many lives you have. He despawns if you get away far enough from him.
